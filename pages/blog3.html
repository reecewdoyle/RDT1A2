            <h1>How much is too much caffeine for a school teacher?</h1>

            <p>In the caffeinated wonderland of education, teachers often find themselves navigating the precarious tightrope between staying awake during a riveting history lesson and accidentally launching into an impromptu interpretive dance about the Industrial Revolution. But where exactly is the line drawn between a healthy dose of caffeine and a jittery descent into the depths of overstimulation? It's a question that has haunted teachers' lounges for centuries, or at least since the invention of the chalkboard (which, let's be honest, feels like it was invented in the age of dinosaurs).

            At what point does a teacher's caffeine intake go from being a harmless perk-me-up to a full-blown, jittery rendition of the cha-cha during a PTA meeting? Some educators swear by a steady stream of coffee, insisting it's the only way to survive a marathon of parent-teacher conferences and dodgeball tournaments. Others tread more cautiously, sipping on herbal tea with the fervor of a cat trying to catch a laser pointer dot. Perhaps the real question is not "how much is too much," but rather "how many cups until your lesson plan becomes a caffeine-fueled stand-up comedy routine?" After all, a well-caffeinated teacher is a happy teacher, but a teacher doing the Macarena during algebra class might be pushing it.</p>
